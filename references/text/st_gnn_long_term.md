For **unsupervised early detection of long-term errors** using a **GNN**, follow these key steps:

### 1. **Graph Construction**
   - **Nodes** represent features (variables) at each time step.
   - **Edges** capture relationships between features (based on correlation, causality, or domain knowledge).
   - Include **temporal edges** to connect nodes across different time steps.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
   - Use a **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ST-GNN)**:
     - **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** to capture spatial dependencies.
     - **Temporal layers** (LSTM, GRU, or Transformer) for modelling time evolution.
     - **Attention mechanism** to focus on recent data for early detection of gradual changes.

### 3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Train the GNN to predict the next time step's graph state.
   - Use **residuals** (the difference between predicted and actual values) to identify anomalies.
   - Gradually increasing residuals over time signal a **long-term error** emerging early.

### 4. **Early Warning**
   - Monitor the **cumulative residual error** over longer periods (days, weeks).
   - Use **threshold-based detection**: When cumulative residuals exceed a threshold consistently, flag it as an early indicator of long-term errors.

This approach enables unsupervised detection of errors before they escalate, using the GNNâ€™s ability to model both spatial and temporal relationships in the data.
