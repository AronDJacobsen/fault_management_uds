## Forecasting

- Evaluate steps ahead prediction.
- Evaluate different weather conditions.


## Anomaly Management

#### Detection

*Metrics*: Precision, Recall, Timing.


#### Diagnosis

*Known*: Technical fault.


*Provide*: Visualization tools.

*Possible*:
- Classify faults based on data characteristics.
- Extend synthetic to also generate system-wide faults.


#### Correction

Evaluate **imputation** performance of the correctly identified anomalies based on the **MAE deviation** from the original data.


*Possible*:
- Iterative error removal


## Sensor expansion

- How effective at adding a new sensor to the system?


## Surrogate modelling

- How effective at predicting the system behaviour?
- Comparison with the Mike simulation model.


## Provide a cleaned dataset?
